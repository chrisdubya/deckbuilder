# Deckbuilder Moemate Module

Gives the companion the ability to get card information for crafting decks for Magic: The Gathering

## Testing

To test, make sure the skill is enabled then ask Moe for info about a Magic: The Gathering Card, for example:

```
Can you give me info about the card Memory Deluge?
```

This should produce a response like this: [screenshot](/screenshot.png)
